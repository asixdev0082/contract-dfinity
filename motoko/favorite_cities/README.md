# Favorite cities

This program provides functions that return multiple city names and illustrates how to use a type enclosed by square (`[ ]`) brackets to indicate an *array* of that type.
In this example, the `[Text]` notation indicates an array of a collection of UTF-8 characters, enabling the program to accept and return multiple text strings.
